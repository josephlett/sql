-- Example SQL Project

-- Goal: Analyze customer purchase behavior on a fictional e-commerce site

-- Import relevant tables
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  email VARCHAR(255),
  age INT,
  city VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id INT,
  date DATE,
  total_order_price DECIMAL(10,2),
  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id)
);

-- Filter customers by location
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE city = 'New York';

-- Find average order value by customer age group
SELECT AVG(o.total_order_price) AS avg_order_value, c.age
FROM orders o
  JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id
GROUP BY c.age;

-- Visualize data through charts and graphs on a user interface
